# Module 8 - Problem Set No. 14 Problem 1

## Retail Therapy

Write a class named **RetailItem** that holds data about an item in a retail store.

The class should store the following in attributes:

- item description
- units in inventory
- price

Please read all of the instructions to the very end.

Once you have written the class, write a program that creates three **RetailItem** objects and stores the following data in them:

```text
Description         Units in Inventory      Price
Jacket              400                     $50.00
Designer Jeans      20                      $79.00
Shirt               3000                    $39.94
```

- Now write a loop that iterates through the list of objects and displays each of the objects properties.
